# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Bailey (she/her) and I like to build interesting things on the web.

I'm a full stack software engineer, building projects with JavaScript and TypeScript! 

I love digital products, and "indiehacking" businesses. You can usually find me programming, using Notion or reading about weird internet sub cultures on twitter.
