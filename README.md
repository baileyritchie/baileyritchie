# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Bailey (she/her) and I like to build interesting things on the web.

I'm a recent college graduate (in Chemical Engineering) and am searching for my first Full-Stack Dev role. I began coding around a year ago, and I consider myself to be self-taught. I'm spending time studying JS fundamentals now, but I'm also working on building smaller portfolio projects. I love building in JavaScript ( with React and Node ), but also have done other projects with data analysis in Python. 

I love digital products, and "indiehacking" businesses. You can usually find me programming, using Notion or reading about weird internet sub cultures on twitter.
